==== Characteristics of the 65c02

_(This section is adapted from the Tali Forth 2 Manual)_

Since this is a bare-metal Cthulhu Lisp, the most important consideration is the target
processor. The 65c02 only has one full register, the accumulator A, as well as
two secondary registers X and Y. All are 8-bit wide. There are 256 bytes that
are more easily addressable on the Zero Page. A single hardware stack is used
for subroutine jumps. The address bus is 16 bits wide for a maximum of 64 KiB of
RAM and ROM. 

For the default setup, we assume 32 KiB of each, but allow this to be changed so
people can adapt Tali to their own hardware.
