=== Horror out the box: py65mon

Cthulhu Scheme is set up so it will run with py65mon from the get-go. 


=== Specialized mayhem: Assembler flags

`DEBUG` (boolean). If set to `true`, the debug routines and calls are turned on
and a bunch of internal data is published. You probably don't want to use this
unless you really want to get into the internals. 

NOTE: Currently, debug mode is enabled by default. This will change once we hit
a higher version number.

`OCTAL` (boolean). One of the unspeakable nameless ancient horrors are octal
numbers. The Scheme language supports them via `#o` syntax, but since normal,
sane people don't use them anymore, they are turned off here by default with a
`false` value. Set this to true if you are into 70's horror.


=== Your very own monster: Adapting for hardware

To make it easier to adapt Cthulhu Scheme to actual hardware, you can add your
own configuration file in the `platforms` folder.
