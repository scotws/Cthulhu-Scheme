Cthulhu Scheme would never have been possible without the help of a very large
number of people, very few of whom I have actually met.

First, there is the crew at http://6502.org[6502.org](((6502.org))) who not
only helped me build my own actual, working 6502 computer, but also introduced
me to Forth. This led me to create Tali Forth, which led me down a rabbit hole
to an amazing project with lots of people and great learning experiences. 

Special thanks go out to Sam Colwell((("Colwell, Sam"))) who contributed an
enormous amount of work and code to Tali Forth 2 and in doing so introduced me
to various concepts. Cthulhu borrows heavily from structure and code of Tali
Forth, so there is quite a bit of Sam in here as well. 

Thank you, everybody.
