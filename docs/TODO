First version: 30. March 2020
This version: 01. Apr 2020

List of things to do. This file will be superceded by GitHub Issues once the
project is uploaded and slightly more mature.


TO DO SHORT TERM

- Make "(newline) (newline)" work
- Reset Data and 6502 stack when starting REPL
- Process special forms, starting with (quote)
- Move tokenizer from "case" statements to jump table
- Get (not #t) working as first process with operands
- Get (not (not #t)) working for depth tree processing
- Get (quote (#x1 #x2)) working for quoting
- Process procedures, starting with (display) and (+)
- Write a debug procedure to dump the string table


TO DO LONG TERM

- Output as decimal numbers by default
- Accept decimal numbers as input
- REPL: See about adding history buffers once we know how much space we will be
  using
- Write a Python tool that walks through headers.asm and makes sure that the
  jump offset to the exec_table in procedures has the same offset
- Write a debug procedure to dump the symbol table
