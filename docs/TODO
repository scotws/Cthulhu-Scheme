First version: 30. March 2020
This version: 15. Apr 2020

List of things to do. This file will be superceded by GitHub Issues once the
project is uploaded and slightly more mature.

TODO SHORT TERM

- Process strings (adds internment while still self-evaluating; string table)
- Process empty list "()" (deal with input of parens with whitespace processing)


TODO LONG TERM

- REPL: See about adding history buffers once we know how much space we will be
  using


DONE
2020-04-15 - Create basic skelton for eval (all self-evaluating anyway)
