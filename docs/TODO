TODO file for Cthulhu Scheme
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
First version: 30. March 2020
This version: 14. Apr 2020

List of things to do. This file will be superceded by GitHub Issues once the
project is uploaded and slightly more mature.

TODO SHORT TERM

- Create basic skelton for eval (all self-evaluating anyway)
- Process naked strings (adds internment while still self-evaluating; string
  table)
- Process empty list "()" (deal with input of parens with whitespace processing)

TODO LONG TERM

- REPL: See about adding history buffers once we know how much space we will be
  using


DONE
