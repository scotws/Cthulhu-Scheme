Manifesto for Cthulhu Scheme for the 65c02 Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com> First version: 12. Feb 2018 This version: 23. Mar 2020

This is the initial document for Cthulhu Scheme for the 65c02. It will be
superceded by the real documentation. 


GOAL

Create a native Scheme for the 65c02 in assembler. Because a full Scheme is
pretty much impossible on this hardware, we get as close to possible. 

This is a learning experience in multiple ways for me, as I don't really know
Scheme this well and I've never created a Scheme/Lisp from scratch. In fact, it
seems that nobody really does ...



LITERATURE

Obviously we follow "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by
FEHLT.
