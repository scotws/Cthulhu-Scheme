[quote, Sinclair Target, How Lisp Became God's Own Programming Language] 
It’s worth dwelling for a while on how weird SICP really is, because I think the
book’s weirdness and Lisp’s weirdness get conflated today. (...) Honestly, what
is going on here? Why does the table have animal feet? Why is the woman
gesturing at the table? What is the significance of the inkwell? <<ST>>
