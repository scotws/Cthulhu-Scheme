Your code sucks but I'd like to learn more about Lovecraft::
        I can recommend _The New Annotated H.P. Lovecraft_ by Leslie S. Klinger
        <<LSK>>, which has beautiful illustrations and lots of great footnotes.
        The only glaring ommission is the short story
        link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cats_of_Ulthar[The Cats of
        Ulthar](((Cats of Ulthar, The))). I had briefly considered "Ulthar" as a name for this project
        but there is just too much fun to be had with the age of Lisp and the
        6502 and the Ancient Ones.

Wait, I hear Lovecraft was a racist jerk::
        Actually, it's worse. In his introduction to Klinger's book, Alan
        Moore(((Moore, Alan))) speaks of Lovecraft's "problematic stance on most
        contemporary issues, with his racism, alleged misogyny, class prejudice,
        dislike of homosexuality, and anti-Semitism". Fortunately, Cthulhu seems
        to be an open-minded, equal-opportunity sort of fellow who will bring
        horror and dread to everybody regardless of gender, race, or sexual
        preference.
