; Default kernel file for Tpol Lisp
; Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
; First version: 19. Jan 2014 (Tali Forth)
; This version: 12. Feb 2014
;
; This section attempts to isolate the hardware-dependent parts of Tpol Lisp
; to make it easier for people to port it to their own machines. Ideally, you
; shouldn't have to touch the other files. There are three routines and one 
; string that must be present for Tali to run:
;
;       kernel_init - Initialize the low-level hardware
;       kernel_getc - Gets a single character in A from the keyboard
;       kernel_putc - Prints the character in A to the screen
;       s_kernel_id - The zero-terminated string printed at boot
;
; This default version Tpol ships with is written for the py65mon machine 
; monitor (see docs/MANUAL.md for details). 

; The main file of Tpol got us to $e000. However, py65mon by default puts
; the basic I/O routines at the beginning of $f000. We don't want to change
; that because it would make using it out of the box harder, so we just 
; advance past the virtual hardware addresses.
.advance $f006

; All vectors currently end up in the same place - we restart the system
; hard. If you want to use them on actual hardware, you'll have to redirect
; them all.
