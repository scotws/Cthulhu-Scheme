Cthulhu Scheme is based on code and information provided by kind people for free
and without strings attached. It would therefore be plain wrong to try to make
money from it or encumber it legally. Because of this, Cthulhu Scheme is placed
in the public domain. Where external code was used, it was also from the public
domain. See source code for documentation of individual routines. 

Cthulhu Scheme is provided on an "as is" basis without any warranty of any kind,
including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose and their equivalents under the laws of any
jurisdiction. Put briefly, use this at your own risk.
