Cthulhu Scheme is based on code an information provided by kind people for free
and without string attached. It would be plain wrong to try to make money for it
or otherwise encumber it legally. As such, Cthulhu Scheme is placed in the
public domain. Where external code was used, it was also from the public domain.
See source code for documentation of individual routines. 

Cthulhu Scheme is provided on an "as is" basis without any warranty of any kind,
including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose and their equivalents under the laws of any
jurisdiction. Put briefly, use this at your own risk.
